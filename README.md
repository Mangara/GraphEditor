# Graph Editor

A simple graphical editor for graphs.

## Getting Started

To run the editor, download [GraphEditor.jar](GraphEditor.jar) and run it (make sure you have a recent version of [Java](https://java.com/en/download/)).

Add vertices by clicking, and edges by selecting a vertex and holding Ctrl while clicking another. Right click pans the view, and scrolling zooms.

To build the project, open it with a recent version of [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/).
